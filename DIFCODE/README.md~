- A repository of tools to combine denoising algorithms


# Base Denoising Algorithms

- At the moment the model just tries to combine BM3D and DnCNN denoised images.


- [Diffbatch]  `diffBatch.py`.

This Matlab Code loops through all the test images.  It adds a set amount of AWGN (at
the moment sigma = 25) and saves the noising image.  The noisy image needs to
saved to comparisons need to be made. 

BM3D and DnCNN denoising is then implemented on the noisy image and the results
put into the output directories (Denoise0 = DnCNN and Denoise1 = BM3D).

You will need to adjust the paths in this code to your machine, and install
matconvnet and direct the path to it.

- [Training]  `main_train.py`.

This python code defines a combining CNN code and takes all the data from the
input noisy image and the two denoised images to generate the output noise (to
be subtracted from the input in training.

- [Training]  `main_test.py`.
